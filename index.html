        <h1>Hi, Ri<span></span> 
        <p>I hope you know that you are the prettiest girl in the world with the most beautiful soul. My lovely. 
            This Dashain I apoligize that you are not at home and you miss home dearly. 
            However, we will try to make sure that is not the case from next year on.
            You are as precious as Rubies, as bright as the sun, 
            as calm and peaceful as the moon and a ray of light that sheds hope in my life.
            I love you baby Ri. My special special little princess.
